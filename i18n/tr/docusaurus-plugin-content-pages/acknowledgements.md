Bob Simons, orijinal ana yazarERDDAP™  (Tasarımcı ve yazılım geliştiricisi kim yazdıERDDAP- spesifik kod) . Başlangıç noktası Roy Mendelssohn'un (Bob'un patronu) Bob'un ConvertTable programını başlattığına dair öneri (Bir formattan diğerine tabular verileri dönüştüren küçük bir fayda ve bu büyük ölçüde Bob'un önceden kodlanmıştır.NOAABob'un açık kaynak olması için yeniden lisanslı olduğu çalışma) Bir web hizmetine.

Bu ve Roy Mendelssohn'un dağıtılmış veri sistemleri hakkındaki fikirleri, Bob'a ilk önerisi ve devam eden desteği (Donanım, ağ ve diğer yazılım desteği de dahil olmak üzere ve Bob'un zamanını ücretsiz olarak, böylece daha fazla zaman geçirebilirdi.ERDDAP™Kod kodu kod kodu kod kodu) Bu projeyi mümkün kıldı ve büyümesini etkinleştirdi.

İşte yazılım ve veri setlerinin listesi budur ki bunlar içindeERDDAP™dağıtım. Bunların hepsi için çok minnettarız. Çok teşekkür ederim.
\\[2021'de başlayarak, tüm kod kaynaklarını doğru bir şekilde listelemek neredeyse imkansız hale geldiERDDAP™Çünkü kullandığımız kütüphanelerin birkaçı (Özellikle netcdf-java ve özellikle AWS) Dönüşte birçok, diğer kütüphane kullanın. Tüm kütüphaneler,ERDDAP™Kod aramaları doğrudan aşağıda listelenmiştir, çünkü diğer kütüphanelerin sırayla çağrıladığı birçok kütüphanedir.
