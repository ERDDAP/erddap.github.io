The main point of the paper is that the default page size for netcdf4/hdf5 files is 4096 bytes (4KB) - (which is terrible for cloud!) since the metadata size alone is likely larger than this and more than likely your chunk sizes are also larger than this. So an extract will require a lot round-trips which is slow.

Second, you might have a lot of tooling that depends on netcdf files, and this approach would mean not having to retool what could be an extensive amount of code.
