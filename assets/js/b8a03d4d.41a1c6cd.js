Most tabular datasets are relatively small, so a 1 or 2 TB SSD is probably sufficient to hold all of the data files for all of your tabular datasets. SSD's eventually wear out if you write data to a cell, delete it, and write new data to that cell too many times. So if you just use your SSD to write the data once and read it many times, even a consumer-grade SSD should last a very long time, probably much longer than any Hard Disk Drive (HDD). Consumer-grade SSD's are now cheap (in 2018, ~$200 for 1 TB or ~$400 for 2 TB) and prices are still falling fast. When ERDDAP\u2122 accesses a data file, an SSD offers both shorter latency (~0.1ms, versus ~3ms for an HDD, versus ~10(?)ms for a RAID, versus ~55ms for Amazon S3) and higher throughput (~500 MB/S, versus ~75 MB/s for an HDD, versus ~500 MB/s for a RAID). So you can get a big performance boost (up to 10X versus a HDD) for $200! Compared to most other possible changes to your system (a new server for $10,000? a new RAID for $35,000? a new network switch for $5000? etc.), this is by far the best Return On Investment (ROI). If/when the SSD dies (in 1, 2, ... 8 years), replace it. Don't rely on it as for long term, archival storage of the data, just for the front-end copy of the data.
