Good patterns are good because they encapsulate good, easy to create and work with, general-purpose solutions that lead to systems with good properties. Pattern names are not standardized, so I'll call the pattern that ERDDAP\u2122 uses the Lego Pattern. Each Lego (each ERDDAP) is a simple, small, standard, stand-alone, brick (data server) with a defined interface that allows it to be linked to other legos (ERDDAPs). The parts of ERDDAP\u2122 that make up this system are: the subscription and flagURL systems (which allows for communication between ERDDAPs), the EDD...FromErddap redirect system, and the system of RESTful requests for data which can be generated by users or other ERDDAPs. Thus, given two or more legos (ERDDAPs), you can create a huge number of different shapes (network topologies of ERDDAPs). Sure, the design and features of ERDDAP\u2122 could have been done differently, not Lego-like, perhaps just to enable and optimize for one specific topology. But we feel that ERDDAP's Lego-like design offers a good, general-purpose solution that enables any ERDDAP\u2122 administrator (or group of administrators) to create all kinds of different federation topologies. For example, a single organization could set up three (or more) ERDDAPs as shown in the ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"#recommendations",children:"ERDDAP\u2122 Grid/Cluster Diagram above"}),". Or a distributed group (IOOS? CoastWatch? NCEI? NWS? NOAA? USGS? DataONE? NEON? LTER? OOI? BODC? ONC? JRC? WMO?) can set up one ERDDAP\u2122 in each small outpost (so the data can stay close to the source) and then set up a composite ERDDAP\u2122 in the central office with virtual datasets (which are always perfectly up-to-date) from each of the small outpost ERDDAPs. Indeed, all of the ERDDAPs, installed at various institutions around the world, which get data from other ERDDAPs and/or provide data to other ERDDAPs, form a giant network of ERDDAPs.
