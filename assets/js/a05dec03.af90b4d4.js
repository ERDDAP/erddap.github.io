[My belief is: using local times and different date/time formats (2-digit years! mm/dd/yy vs dd/mm/yy vs ... ) in data files forces the end user to do complicated conversions to Zulu time in order to compare data from one dataset with data from another. So ERDDAP\u2122 standardizes all time data: For string times, ERDDAP\u2122 always uses the ISO 8601:2004(E) standard format, for example, 1985-01-02T00:00:00Z. For numeric times, ERDDAP\u2122 always uses "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z". ERDDAP\u2122 always uses the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone to remove the difficulties of working with different time zones and standard time versus daylight saving time.
