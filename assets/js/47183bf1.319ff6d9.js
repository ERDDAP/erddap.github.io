When a user makes a request, ERDDAP\u2122 has to read all the data from all of the files that might have data matching the user's request. If the user asks for data from a limited time (e.g., one day or one month), then ERDDAP\u2122 won't have to open too many files in your dataset. But there are extreme cases where almost every file might have matching data (e.g., when waterTemperature=13.2C). Since it takes ERDDAP\u2122 a little bit of time (partly the seek time on the HDD, partly the time to read the file's header) just to open a given file (and more if there are lots of files in the directory), there is a significant time penalty if the total number of files that ERDDAP\u2122 has to open is very large. Even opening 1000 files takes significant time. So there are benefits to periodically consolidating the daily files into larger chunks (e.g., 1 station for 1 year). I understand that you might not want to do this for various reasons, but it does lead to much faster responses. In extreme cases (e.g., I deal with a GTSPP dataset that has ~35 million source files), serving data from a huge number of source files is impractical because ERDDAP's response to simple queries can take hours and use tons of memory.

At that time and since, OOI was committed to their versioning system and not interested in alternatives. In 2016, other aspects of this plan fell into place and I started to implement it. Because there were lots of interruptions to work on other projects, I didn't finish until 2018.
