# ERDDAP™ Release Process
* Make sure image comparison files are available (this might mean running `mvn verify`, if you want to speed that up restrict to just the ImageComparison group though note that still requires running Jetty tests)
* Update dependencies
```
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates   // (displays updates)
mvn versions:use-latest-versions  // (updates dependencies, though sometimes we don’t want to do all of them)
mvn versions:update-properties // (updates versions in the property block)
```
* Update plugins
```
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates // (displays updates, need to manually update)
```
* Run tests to make sure dependency updates didn’t break anything for all major configurations (datasets parsing in particular, though any other significant settings as well)
```
mvn verify
```
* Use TranslateMessages.translate() to update translations if needed
* EDStatic.java set developmentMode to false, change the version number and specify the release date.
* Do the build
```
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn package
```
## Canary
Send the war file for distribution on the Coastwatch server or some other server that uses most of the dataset types and receives a lot of traffic.
We want to try to find errors before wider distribution of the build.

Include message when telling about a new release.

The standard procedure is:
* Upload the .war file to coastwatch \[tomcat\]/content/erddap/
* As user=tomcat:
  * In \[tomcat\]/bin/ :
        ./shutdown.sh   //use "ps -fu tomcat" to ensure it has stopped
  * In \[tomcat\]/webapps/ :
        rm -rf erddap
        rm erddap.war
        cp ../content/erddap/erddap2.22.war erddap.war   //or whatever the number is
  * In \[tomcat\]/bin/ :
        ./startup.sh
  * After the ERDDAP has returned a web page, in \[tomcat\]/webapps/ :
        chgrp -R erddap erddap
        chmod -R g+rw erddap
        chmod -R o-rwx erddap
