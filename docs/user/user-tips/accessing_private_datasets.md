Sunny Hospital wrote a great blog post about accessing private datasets programmatically.

The example is in Python. You may be able to adapt it to other languages. If you do, it'd be great if you could share your workflow to make it easier for others.

Please [read it on the blog](https://shospital.github.io/blog/posts/blog-post/erddap_private_dataset.html).

Note from the ERDDAP developers for the future. Improving the process for accessing private datasets programmatically is on the list or [Priority Projects](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap/issues/158).
