# Documentation Intro

Documentation is grouped into categories focused on the types of activities that are covered. There's a section of docs for [server administrators](/docs/category/server-administration/), [project contributors](/docs/category/contributing/), and [users](/docs/category/user/).

We also have [javadoc for the Script classes](/docs/dokka/) that will be useful for those defining datasets.

## Support {#support}
There are several ways to get support with ERDDAP™.
### Google Group {#google-group}
For users and administrators the [ERDDAP™ Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/erddap) is often a good starting point. You can search to see if your question has been covered. There are many friendly folk who can help answer your questions. Asking publicly can help others with similar problems and especially for issues related to server configuration the community may have experience that ERD does not.
### E-mail {#e-mail}
You can email ERD directly at: erd dot data at noaa dot gov
### GitHub {#github}
For bug reports, security issues, feature requests, and code issues use the [ERDDAP™ GitHub](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap/).
